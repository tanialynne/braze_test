Take-Home Assignment
Technical Learning Experience Specialist
Overview
Thank you for taking the time to complete this exercise. We've designed this assignment to learn about your technical skill set, user-centered design process, and ability to creatively manage ambiguity. In this assignment, you will take a course design document for a short lesson and turn it into an html package that we can upload to our Learning Management System.
These instructions, along with all of the other resources you’ll need, are located in this Google Drive folder.
Instructions
Review this lesson design document. It lays out the content for a simple e-learning lesson. This content includes text, images, a code snippet for an embedded video, and a single-select multiple-choice knowledge check question.


Build a web package that presents this content as a single page.
Your web package must be a zipped folder containing a single index.html file, along with whatever supporting files and directories you need.
Your page should follow web accessibility standards.
Your design should respond to different screen sizes.
You must style your page using a standalone css file. If you know it, we'd love to see you use scss.
You must include some javascript — for any purpose you want — also as a standalone file. The multiple-choice question could make a good opportunity to use javascript, but you might also consider building another interactive element that uses javascript to present some of the content.
Please comment your code throughout.


Whenever in doubt, prioritize clarity and accessibility with your design choices.


When you're done, please upload your project to a github repository and send its link to Matt Chamberlain (matthew.chamberlain@braze.com).


Feel free to ask as many questions as you'd like throughout the process.
